TMS9900 UART Order of Operations
For use with TR-1602

Transmit
Check pin 22 THRE for a high level to see if transmit holding register is empty
Put low level on pin 23 THRL to load a new value into transmit holding register

Receive
Pin 19 DR outputs a high level when a byte has been received
     - This hits the interrupt request pin
     - This also places an interrupt value on the IRQ level pins
Put low level on pin 18 DRR to reset DR line
Put low level on pin 4 RRD to output parallel data onto RR1 - RR8
